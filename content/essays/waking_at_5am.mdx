Inspired from [this medium article](https://betterhumans.pub/how-to-wake-up-at-5-a-m-every-day-ceb02e29c802)

- Start reading  [Haruki Murakami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruki_Murakami)’s novels. it seems interesting #toreading
- The repetition itself becomes the important thing; it’s a form of mesmerism.
- Mesmerising things to do has contributed a lot to him, its like tieing one habit to the other as clear says in [[Atomic Habits]].
- A drive of motivation will be there for waking up early when we practise it.
- Create and cultivate a strong purpose for waking up earlier, create routine/ what to do after waking up earlier- if its a useless time spending thing(simply sitting isnt considered one), like scrolling phone, dont consider waking up early for it.
  - create a purpose that extends than a basic task
- Run a  [5 Whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys) analysis [[5 Why Analysis]]
  - Strat of with a small problem and work up to the root of it to find a real need to wakeup early.
- Consider what you gain and loose
  - gains
    - Early morning distraction free hours.
    - prefrontal cortex is most active right after waking up, making it optimal for creativity
    - Writing and creative input is high at morning times.(Personally experienced this)
    - ultimately you gain a few hours with solitude on yourself.
  - loses
    - mostly the late night munches you earlier used to enjoy and devour will be gone.
    - youll start the day slowly thinking that you have a lot of time in your sleeve.
    - In my case, the cold in the mornings cause me allergy, so sneezing and runny nose alert.
    - You feel like youre running out of time.
      - if youre a student or a worker, your work/college time ends typically by 5(for me my college ends at 4 and i talk with other people and spend an hour in college), this leaves with less time for you to do things that you usually did.
- You should give yourself some off days to the schedule. \* somedays everything doesnt all go well as i planned, i need to shift the time i need to go to sleep. but limiting it to once a day.
  Ask yourself these two questions:

* What will I gain with the extra time in the morning?
* What will I lose with the lost time at night?

Then ask yourself: ==“Do the benefits outweigh the costs?”==

- start of by sleeping more than you intend to.
- try waking up naturally when your body awakens itself.
- **Dont try to introduce drastic changes to your life**
- Do something you really like(watching Youtube does count)doing to get your day started.
- **Start and plan a morning routine tailored for you.**
  - no blogs or articles are going to really plan what you want to do, so tailor one to yourselves.
- One day [[2023-02-17]]of waking up early feels like good.
